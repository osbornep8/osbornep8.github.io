- Conducted an [in-depth study](https://github.com/osbornep8/portfolioprojects/tree/main/masters_dissertation) on working memory capacity and attention by measuring CDA and P300 event-related potentials during a change detection task.

- CDA is used as a quantitative measure of working memory capacity and P300 is used as an indicator of attention. I used the P3b which is the P300 ERP collected from the parietal region of the brain to identify lapses in attention and the change in latency as an indicator of reduced attention over each subsequent block of the experiment (as the duration of the experiment was quite long).

- We used MATLAB to develop the psychological experiment and collect behavioural responses of the participants and their respective neural signal data from a BioSemi ActiveTwo 64-channel system.

- Collected a comprehensive dataset from university students through the EEG system. Employed a robust analytical toolkit including Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Plotly) for statistical analysis and visualization. You can view my in-depth analysis from my [notebooks](https://github.com/osbornep8/portfolioprojects/tree/main/masters_dissertation/notebooks).

- Additionally, I developed an interactive dashboard to visualize and present the findings, powered by Streamlit. You can view the code for this over [here](https://github.com/osbornep8/portfolioprojects/blob/main/masters_dissertation/main.py) and my streamlit dashboard [here](https://mastersdissertation-portfolioproject.streamlit.app/).
