- Conducted an [in-depth study](<(https://github.com/osbornep8/portfolioprojects/tree/main/masters_dissertation)>) on working memory capacity and attention by measuring CDA and P300 event-related potentials during a change detection task.

- Collected a comprehensive dataset from university students through EEG data acquisition. Employed a robust analytical toolkit including Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Plotly) and MS Excel for statistical analysis and hypothesis testing. You can view my in-depth analysis from my [notebooks](https://github.com/osbornep8/portfolioprojects/tree/main/masters_dissertation/notebooks).

- Additionally, developed an interactive dashboard to visualize and present the findings, powered by Streamlit. You can view my [python dashboard](https://github.com/osbornep8/portfolioprojects/blob/main/masters_dissertation/main.py).
